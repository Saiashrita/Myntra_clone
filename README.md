## 🤖 AI Integration

This app uses Hugging Face models (like `gpt2`, `bert-base-uncased`, or fashion-specific models) to generate outfit suggestions based on user prompts or filters.

**Example Prompt:**  
_"Suggest a stylish outfit for a summer party for women"_

You can customize the model endpoint via Hugging Face API in the backend like so:

```js
const response = await fetch("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/YOUR_MODEL", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ inputs: "Your prompt here" }),
});
